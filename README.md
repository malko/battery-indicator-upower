# Battery-indicator (upower)
This is a gnome-shell extension to display your connected devices battery information as reported by upower in the status panel.

Clicking on the indicators will reveal a menu which will let you display more information about connected devices:
* icon identifier
* icon of battery state as reported by upower
* device model
* (state of the battery)
* battery level percentage

> Good to know:
> upower is not always reliable on reporting battery level for connected devices. Generally it will tell you that you should ignore the reported battery level. In such cases this extensions will write the percentage level indicator in italic. Same representation will be used for corresponding popup menu entry.
